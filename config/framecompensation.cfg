[frame_expansion_compensation]
temp_coeff: 0.01123200
#   Coefficient of linear expansion for the frame material [μm/m·°C].
#   E.g. 23.4 μm/m·°C for Misumi A6N01SS-T5 6005A-T5 aluminum alloy.
#frame_z_length: 480
#   Total length of vertical extrusions [mm].
#gantry_factor:
#   Relationship between gantry expansion and toolhead Z movement.
#   Examples:
#      if 1mm expansion moves toolhead up 1mm, gantry_factor: 1.0
#      if 1mm expansion moves toolhead up 0.5mm, gantry_factor: 0.5
#      if 1mm expansion moves toolhead down 1mm, gantry_factor: -1.0
#   The default is 1.0.
#max_comp_z:
#   Disables compensation above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
#   will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z position
#   again. The default is 0.0mm (always on).
#max_z_offset:
#   Maximum absolute compensation that can be applied to the Z axis [mm]. The
#   default is 99999999.0mm (unlimited).

z_stepper: stepper_z
#   The Z stepper motor linked with the Z endstop, as written in printer.cfg.
#   Used for triggering reference temperature measurement. Usually 'stepper_z'
#   unless otherwise defined.
